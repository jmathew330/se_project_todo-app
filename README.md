# Simple Todo App

A simple and user-friendly Todo application where users can add tasks, set optional due dates, and mark tasks as completed. This app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Functionality

- <b>Set Due Date (Optional):</b> You can optionally set a due date for each todo, helping users organize tasks based on deadlines.
- <b>Mark Todos as Completed:</b> Each todo item includes a checkbox that allows users to mark the task as completed. Completed tasks can be visually distinguished from active tasks.
- <b>Delete Todos:</b> Users can delete completed or unnecessary tasks to keep the list tidy.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and works across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## Technology
